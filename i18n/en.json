    "quickReplies": {
      "debtVsInvestment": {
        "question": "I have debt, should I invest?",
        "answer": "No, I recommend paying off your debts first. Because debt interest rates (typically 15-30%) are much higher than investment returns (8-12%). By paying off high-interest debts first, you can achieve a 'guaranteed return'. Then start investing."
      },
      "emergencyFund": {
        "question": "How much should my emergency fund be?",
        "answer": "Your emergency fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses. For example, if your monthly expenses are $1,000, you should have $3,000-6,000 in emergency savings. Keep this money in an easily accessible account (savings account or money market fund)."
      },
      "savingsRate": {
        "question": "How much should I save?",
        "answer": "You should save at least 20% of your income. If you're aiming for early retirement (FIRE), you may need to save 50% or more. Start small: Save 10% first, then increase by 5% annually."
      },
      "fireBasics": {
        "question": "What is FIRE, how do I start?",
        "answer": "FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is the early retirement movement. Basic rule: Save 25 times your annual expenses. For example, if you spend $40,000 per year, you need to save $1,000,000. If you invest this at 4% return, you'll earn $40,000 per year."
      },
      "investmentStart": {
        "question": "How should I make my first investment?",
        "answer": "1) First, build an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses). 2) Pay off high-interest debts. 3) Then start investing: You can begin with index funds or stock funds. Start with small amounts, invest regularly monthly."
      },
      "debtPayoff": {
        "question": "How should I pay off my debts?",
        "answer": "There are 2 strategies: 1) Snowball: Pay off your smallest debt first, provides motivation. 2) Avalanche: Pay off the highest interest debt first, saves more money. I recommend the Avalanche method because it's more logical."
